Each FC port in an FC switched fabric has its own unique FC port address for routing purposes. The FC port address is assigned by a switch in the fabric when that port logs in to the fabric. This property refers to the FC port address given to the physical host bus adapter (HBA) port when the port performs a fabric login (FLOGI).<br/>
