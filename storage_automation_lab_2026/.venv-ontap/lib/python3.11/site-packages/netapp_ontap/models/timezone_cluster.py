</br>
The initial first node in cluster setting for time zone is "Etc/UTC".
"Etc/UTC" is the IANA timezone "Area/Location" specifier for
Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), which is an offset of 0.
### IANA time zone format
The IANA time zone, formatted as "Area/Location", is based on geographic areas that have had the same time zone offset for many years.
</br>
"Location" represents a compound name using additional forward slashes.
</br>
An example of the "Area/Location" time zone is "America/New_York" and represents most of the United States Eastern Time Zone.
Examples of "Area/Location" with "Location" as a compound name are "America/Argentina/Buenos_Aires" and "America/Indiana/Indianapolis".
### ONTAP traditional time zone
Examples of the traditional time zones are "EST5EDT" for the United States Eastern Time Zone and "CET" for Central European Time Zone.
