  | 5375959 | Network ports are disabled. |
  | 5375960 | Network ports are enabled, but not reporting a connected FC fabric. |
  | 5375961 | The limit for the number of FC network interfaces on a cluster node has been reached. |
  | 5375962 | The limit for the number of FC network interfaces on a port has been reached. |
  | 5375963 | An HA pair of cluster nodes has a discrepancy in the presence of FC ports. |
  | 5375964 | An HA pair of cluster nodes has a discrepancy in support for an FC data protocol. |
  | 5375965 | An HA pair of cluster nodes cannot be reached from the same FC fabrics. |
  | 5375966 | A cluster node cannot be reached from all of the FC fabrics from which other cluster nodes with FC interfaces in the SVM can be reached. |
  | 5375967 | The limit for the number of FC network interfaces on a cluster node has been exceeded. |
  | 5375968 | The limit for the number of FC network interfaces on an FC port has been exceeded. |
  | 5375969 | The requested number of network interfaces per FC fabric per cluster node has not been achieved. |
  | 5375970 | The SVM cannot be reached from all of the FC fabrics to which the cluster is connected. |
  | 5375971 | The limit for the number of NVMe network interfaces on a cluster node has been exceeded. |
  | 5375972 | The limit for the number of cluster nodes containing NVMe network interfaces for the SVM has been exceeded. |
  | 5375973 | The SVM can be reached from a number of FC fabrics other than what is preferred. |
