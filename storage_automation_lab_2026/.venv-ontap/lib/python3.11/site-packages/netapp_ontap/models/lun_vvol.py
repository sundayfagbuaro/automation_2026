A class `vvol` LUN must be bound to a class `protocol_endpoint` LUN in order to be accessed. Class `protocol_endpoint` and `vvol` LUNs allow many-to-many bindings. A LUN of one class is allowed to be bound to zero or more LUNs of the opposite class. The binding between any two specific LUNs is reference counted. When a binding is created that already exists, the binding count is incremented. When a binding is deleted, the binding count is decremented, but the LUNs remain bound if the resultant reference count is greater than zero. When the binding count reaches zero, the binding is destroyed.<br/>
The bindings array contains LUNs of the opposite class of the containing LUN object.<br/>
There is an added computational cost to retrieving property values for `vvol.bindings`. They are not populated for a GET request unless explicitly requested using the `fields` query parameter. See [`Requesting specific fields`](#Requesting_specific_fields) to learn more. """
